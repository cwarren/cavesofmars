Screens:
- Caves of Mars title/splash screen
- story screen
- class selection screen
- play screen
    + maps: surface, upper caves, gateway boss cave, lower tunnels
- item selection screen
- falling animation screen

- 

Game Jam Goals:

- re-theme what I have for my chosen setting & story
  + come up with story-consistent justification for experience system (and probably modify that system accordingly)
- split messaging display into a separate screen than the main map/play area
  + implement message history system
  + create (and make use of) richer descriptions of observable things and narrative elements/events
- refactor fog of war to use a secondary map rather than the live map (i.e. avoid showing distant map changes)
- implement throwing/ranged action
- design and implement a richer melee combat system (at the least, split out hitting, damaging, other hit effects, dodging, damage resistance, and on-being-hit effects)
- integrate thrown/fired items into the combat system
- improve map generation with a bit more tile variety
  + improve impenetrable map borders
- multi-staged digging
- design and implement a simple loot system (or, rather, give appropriate items to appropriate NPCs, and have those items be used)
- design and implement a simple keyed-door system
- boss key gives you access to win state

TODO NEXT:
1. when the level is fully lit don't limit look info to sight radius
2. when player starts in the caves scatter rubble and rocks around them
3. give player starting gear when they enter the play screen (play screen init); equip approp things; on falling unequip some stuff, replace it with broken versions, and scatter it around the player instead of having it in their inventory
4. improve the falling screen (make it a real map)
8. improve surface map (add quake event w/ radio comments from team mates)
