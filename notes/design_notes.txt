Screens:
- Caves of Mars title/splash screen
- story screen
- class selection screen
- play screen
    + maps: surface, upper caves, gateway boss cave, lower tunnels
- item selection screen
- falling animation screen

- 

Game Jam Goals:

- split messaging display into a separate screen than the main map/play area
  + implement message history system

- refactor fog of war to use a secondary map rather than the live map (i.e. avoid showing distant map changes)

- implement throwing/ranged action

- design and implement a richer melee combat system (at the least, split out hitting, damaging, other hit effects, dodging, damage resistance, and on-being-hit effects)

- integrate thrown/fired items into the combat system

- improve impenetrable map borders

- multi-staged digging

- design and implement a simple loot system (or, rather, give appropriate items to appropriate NPCs, and have those items be used)

- design and implement a simple keyed-door system

- boss key gives you access to win state


standard starting gear:

JATT - Jack-of-All-Trades-Tool - shovel/pick/axe/staff/prybar

Multitool - [leatherman]

TODO NEXT:

5. implement multi-stage digging
6. implement spore-y mass use (drop on corpse)
7. tweak entity numbers so they scale w/ PC a bit better

50. design/implement alternate path to victory(ish) - post death, if killed at least one ooze and at least one fungus, or if killed by fungus, option to revive and play as a fungal zombie - food consumption increases dramatically, allied with fungus, no further equipping, but still can level/improve
