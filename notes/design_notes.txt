Screens:
- Caves of Mars title/splash screen
- story screen
- class selection screen
- play screen
    + maps: surface, upper caves, gateway boss cave, lower tunnels
- item selection screen
- falling animation screen

- 

Game Jam Goals:

- split messaging display into a separate screen than the main map/play area
  + implement message history system

- refactor fog of war to use a secondary map rather than the live map (i.e. avoid showing distant map changes)

- design and implement a richer melee combat system (at the least, split out hitting, damaging, other hit effects, dodging, damage resistance, and on-being-hit effects)

- integrate thrown/fired items into the combat system

- design and implement a simple loot system (or, rather, give appropriate items to appropriate NPCs, and have those items be used)

- design and implement a simple keyed-door system

- boss key gives you access to win state

TODO NEXT:

0. implement spore-y mass use (drop on corpse)


2. when an item is thrown or dropped raise its onLanded event (needed for seeds, but will also be useful for anything else that has an effect when thrown (e.g. grenade-like, etc.))

2.5 consider a spore-y mass repository w/ different kinds of spore-y masses that grow on different things (even consider making this prodecurally generated - can dynamically set targets, exclusions, rates, etc.)
2.75 consider docile fungi occasionally spawning nearby spore-y masses that share the same traits

3. add a fixedExperience entity mixin, and set it up for docile fungi with an xp of 0, and quiescent fungi with an xp of 1


5. when spreading fungi awaken into or spawn a zombie, check depth and consider giving the zombie a level or two

6. when a corpse is dropped, increase its food value by some amount dependent on the max hp of the source entity


7. new item: sling, which uses rocks as ammo (and uses a different equipment slot? refactor the wear/wield process to support generalized equipment slots?)
    (launcher mixin)
    
8. ammo item mixin

8.5 ranged damage bonus when using matching ammo and launcher


9. add new entity: small martian

11.    which can pick up and equip items it finds

12.    and which uses a more interesting / better wander mechanism


20. crafting system!


50. design/implement alternate path to victory(ish) - post death, if killed at least one ooze and at least one fungus, or if killed by fungus, option to revive and play as a fungal zombie - food consumption increases dramatically, allied with fungus, no further equipping, but still can level/improve
