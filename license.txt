This license was added 2022/08/08, and applies retroactively

The source code for Caves of Mars is fully open and free to use,
re-use, modify, build-on, etc. for personal, professional, commercial,
and all other uses, limited only by the licenses of the rot.js and
sprintf.js libraries (and if you pull out those, then it's all fair
game).

If you feel like you rely on it enough that you want to credit me
then I'd be happy with a mention in game credits or in the source
code, but there's no obligation in that regard.

Take it all, make something great, and have fun!
